**Option A - Using GitHub Web Interface** (Easiest):

1. On your new repo page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop ALL 5 files:
   - sentiment_analyzer.py
   - requirements.txt
   - README_SentimentAnalyzer.md (you'll rename it)
   - gitignore.txt (you'll rename it)
   - CONTRIBUTING.md

3. **Before committing**, rename files:
   - Rename `README_SentimentAnalyzer.md` → `README.md`
   - Rename `gitignore.txt` → `.gitignore`

4. Commit message: "Initial commit: sentiment analysis tool with transformers"
5. Click "Commit changes"

**Option B - Using Git Command Line**:

```bash
# Clone your new repo
git clone https://github.com/Timothy-Logan/sentiment-analyzer
cd sentiment-analyzer

# Copy all the downloaded files into this folder
# Then rename:
mv README_SentimentAnalyzer.md README.md
mv gitignore.txt .gitignore

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: sentiment analysis tool with transformers"
git push
```

### Step 3: Add Repository Description & Topics (5 minutes)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **gear icon** next to "About" (top right)
3. Add:
   - **Description**: "Text sentiment analysis tool using pre-trained transformers. Analyzes positive/negative/neutral sentiment with confidence scores."
   - **Topics** (add these one by one):
     - `python`
     - `machine-learning`
     - `sentiment-analysis`
     - `nlp`
     - `transformers`
     - `cli-tool`
     - `natural-language-processing`
     - `deep-learning`
4. Click "Save changes"

---

### Step 4: Pin Repository on Your Profile (2 minutes)

1. Go to your GitHub profile: https://github.com/Timothy-Logan
2. Click "Customize your pins"
3. Check the box for **sentiment-analyzer**
4. Make sure all 3 projects are selected:
   - ✅ Weather-Prediction-Model-
   - ✅ Movie-Recommender
   - ✅ sentiment-analyzer
5. Click "Save pins"

---

### Step 5: Test Locally (Optional - 15 minutes)

If you want to actually run the project:

```bash
# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/Timothy-Logan/sentiment-analyzer
cd sentiment-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analyzer
python sentiment_analyzer.py

# Test with:
# "I love this!" → should be POSITIVE
# "This is awful" → should be NEGATIVE
# Type "quit" to exit
```

**Note**: First run downloads the model (~268MB), takes 1-2 minutes
